# Baby Sweep Frontend Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and customize the values
# Note: All React environment variables must be prefixed with REACT_APP_

# ======================
# API Configuration
# ======================

# API URL - Update this based on your deployment
# For development:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
#
# For production (same domain):
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://babysweep.timmurdoch.com.au
#
# Leave empty to use relative URLs (recommended for production):
REACT_APP_API_URL=

# ======================
# Gender Options
# ======================

# Include the "Surprise" option for gender selection
# Set to 'true' to show Boy, Girl, and Surprise options
# Set to 'false' to show only Boy and Girl options
# Note: This should match the backend setting
REACT_APP_INCLUDE_SURPRISE_GENDER=true

# ======================
# Time Block Settings
# ======================

# Time interval in minutes for time blocks
# Accepted values: 15, 30, or 60
# This determines how granular the time selections can be
# Note: This should match the backend setting
REACT_APP_TIME_BLOCK_MINUTES=30

# Maximum block selection duration in minutes
# This controls how many consecutive time blocks a user can select in the calendar
# Examples:
#   60 = 1 hour maximum
#   120 = 2 hours maximum
#   180 = 3 hours maximum
# Note: This should match the backend setting
REACT_APP_MAX_BLOCK_SELECTION_MINUTES=60

# ======================
# Important Notes
# ======================
#
# 1. After changing any REACT_APP_ variables, you must rebuild the frontend:
#    npm run build
#
# 2. Environment variables are embedded into the build at build time.
#    They are NOT read at runtime.
#
# 3. For consistency, ensure TIME_BLOCK_MINUTES, MAX_BLOCK_SELECTION_MINUTES,
#    and INCLUDE_SURPRISE_GENDER match the backend .env settings.
