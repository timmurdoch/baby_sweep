## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Easiest)

```bash
# Extract the archive
tar -xzf baby-sweep.tar.gz
cd baby-sweep

# Build and run
docker-compose up -d --build

# Check it's running
docker-compose ps
```

### Option 2: Direct Node.js Deployment

```bash
# Extract the archive
tar -xzf baby-sweep.tar.gz
cd baby-sweep

# Build frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# Setup backend
cd ../backend
npm install
node database.js
cp -r ../frontend/build ./public

# Run it
node server.js
```

See **QUICKSTART.md** in the package for detailed step-by-step instructions!

## 🔐 Default Settings

- **Access Password:** `babysweep2025` (CHANGE THIS IMMEDIATELY!)
- **Port:** 3001
- **Time Blocks:** 30 minutes
- **Due Date:** 2025-12-31
- **Allow Duplicates:** Yes

All settings can be changed via the SQLite database (instructions in README.md)

## 🌐 Your Domain Setup

The app is configured for: **babysweep.timmurdoch.com.au**

**Cloudflare Setup:**
1. Add A record: `babysweep` → Your server IP
2. Enable proxy (orange cloud)
3. SSL/TLS: Full (strict) mode
4. Get Cloudflare Origin Certificate and save to `/etc/nginx/ssl/`

**Nginx is configured with:**
- Cloudflare real IP detection
- Security headers
- SSL/TLS support
- Proxy to Node.js backend

## 📊 Database Schema

The SQLite database includes:

**Tables:**
- `settings` - Configuration (password, due date, welcome text, colors)
- `guesses` - All participant guesses with weight in both units
- `sessions` - Authentication tokens

**Pre-configured Settings:**
- app_password
- due_date
- welcome_text
- time_block_minutes
- allow_duplicates
- primary_color

## 🎯 What Works Right Now

✅ Login with password
✅ Submit guesses with all fields
✅ Real-time weight conversion
✅ View all guesses in a grid
✅ Mobile-responsive design
✅ Session persistence
✅ Professional styling

## 🔮 What's Coming in Phase 2

When you're ready for more features, Phase 2 includes:

1. **Admin Panel** - Full admin dashboard with statistics
2. **Calendar View** - Visual calendar showing all guess dates
3. **Pricing Tiers** - Configurable pricing ($10/1, $40/5, $70/10)
4. **Winner Calculation** - Enter birth results and find winners
5. **Export Features** - CSV, Excel, PDF exports
6. **Theme Customization** - Custom colors and themes
7. **Multiple Guesses** - Track multiple guesses per person
8. **Email Notifications** - Send confirmations and announcements

See **PHASE2.md** for full roadmap and implementation details.

## 📝 First Steps After Deployment
